# Claude Code Progress - Mot du Jour

## Current Status ✅
- **Signup Flow**: Working correctly - users created in both Supabase Auth and users table
- **Database**: Fully migrated to Supabase with proper UUID support
- **Server**: Next.js dev server running on localhost:3000
- **Forms**: Phone number and country selector working properly

## What's Been Done ✅
1. Fixed country selector dropdown functionality 
2. Migrated from Drizzle ORM to Supabase for database operations
3. Generated Supabase TypeScript types
4. Fixed column name mismatch (Phone_country -> phone_country)
5. Fixed duplicate variable names in server action
6. Cleaned up debug logging code
7. Verified form data validation works correctly
8. Ensured proper UUID handling for Supabase Auth integration

## Current Files
- `/app/(login)/supabase-actions.ts` - Main signup/signin functions (cleaned up)
- `/app/(login)/login.tsx` - Login/signup form component (cleaned up)
- `/components/country-selector.tsx` - Working country dropdown with phone input
- `/lib/supabase/queries.ts` - Supabase query functions
- `/lib/supabase/types.ts` - Generated TypeScript types

## Next Steps
1. Test signup flow end-to-end
2. Remove remaining Drizzle dependencies (optional cleanup)
3. Add any additional features as needed

## Commands to run
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test signup at
http://localhost:3000/inscription
```

## Key Debugging Added
- File logging in signup function
- Comprehensive console logging
- Form data validation testing
- Server action import verification
